Ask more question than you give answers.

First seek to understand. What did you mean by that? Explain your assumptions hot you got to that conclusion. Who knows more about this than we do? What does this make possible? What was it about your leadership that lead to this?

Questions that lead to self-awareness. What's one way I can help you by being a better leader? What do you think I think about you? What do you know about me that I don't that I need to know?

Questions that uncover opportunities. What would have to be true to get this result?
