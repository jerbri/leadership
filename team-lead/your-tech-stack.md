Growing Your Tech Stack: When to Say No - by Jessica Kerr. Takeaway: An exploration of what tools are Low-Risk \(local developer utilities\), Moderate Risk 1 \(deployment infrastructure\), Moderate Risk 2 \(programming language\), and serious risk \(database\). “When you do accept a technology into your stack, make sure it has an owner. Spread knowledge through pairing, documentation, and communication. Make responsibility explicit and set aside time for maintenance, upgrades, and reassessment. The right technology today will be the wrong technology at some point.”
