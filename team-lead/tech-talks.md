# Tech-Talks

I think the best way for someone to really learn something is to be able to teach others and explain why something is the way it is.

A good tool for that in a team environment is a Tech Talk, and it can be as formal or informal as your team. Have someone present in whatever manner they choose to the team on a topic they're passionate about.
