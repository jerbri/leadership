# Tech-Janitor

@sarah\_edo: Someone was recently telling me they were a "Code Ninja". I don't want to work with a Ninja, they leave a bloody mess. I want to work with a "Code Janitor". Comes in the middle of the night, cleans things up, you only know they were there because everything is organized and tidy.
