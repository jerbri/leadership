From the great Marcus Blanenship's newsletter

Today you will hear someone pose a problem.
Immediately, a solution may jump to mind.
It might be a good solution, too.
A solution you know will work – tried and true.
Maybe even the best solution.

Today, when the moment comes, do nothing.
Be silent and still.
If you’re able, raise an eyebrow: “What do you think?”
If not, simply smile, and wait.

Others might stare at you, expecting you to respond.
It’s okay, they’ll get the hint.

When you do nothing, you might get a great something.
New ideas, perspectives, and new people stepping up to bat.
Sometimes people just need a nudge.
Aren’t those the best somethings?

What do you have to lose?
You can try this “do-nothing management” approach anytime you like.
You always have the option to fall back to doing something.

Give it a try, and let me know what happens.

Best, Marcus
