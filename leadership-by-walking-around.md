# Leadership-by-Walking-Around

The simple act of circulating around your AO and chatting with the people who work with/for you, getting a feel for the climate and seeing people in their element.

Getting bottom-up feedback, get a pulse on your organization, initiate a coaching/mentoring relationship.

Goal is to make the organizaiton better.

Ask them what they're working on, in a curious way and not an "checking in" kind of way. Have them explain their job to you.

WHAT IS YOUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW?

How is everything going?

What's the thing we need to get better at now to become a better company?

How was your vacation/holiday/etc?
