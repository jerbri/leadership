If so, try this the next time someone brings you a problem.  You can steal this word-for-word.

Step 1: Grab a pen and paper
Step 2: Make a brief note about the problem presented. 
Step 3: Say, "Hmm... that is a problem.  What ideas do you have?  I'll make a list."
Step 4: Keep silent for at least two minutes, and write whatever they say.
Step 5: (Optional) If they say, "Well... I don't know." you reply, "Hmm... that sounds like another problem.  How could you get some new ideas?"
Step 6: Repeat Step 4-6 until they have found ideas, or have ideas about how to get ideas.  
Step 7: Hand them the notes you made.  If they don't want them, toss them in the trash.
