It's become popular lately to create a 'person' README for yourself as a manager/leader, aka how can people interface with you for the most benefit.

```
Your expectations drive your teammates' behavior.
```


There are some people who dislike it since it feels very self-serving, but I don't think it's a bad idea to take the time to analyze how you like to operate and try to get those throughts into a coherent document.
