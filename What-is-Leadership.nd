Have a vision and lead change

Be your formationâ€™s moral and ethical compass

Learn, think, and adapt

Balance risk and opportunity to retain the initiative

Build agile, effective, high performing teams

Empower subordinates and underwrite risk

Develop bold, adaptive, and broadened leaders

Communicate-up, down, and laterally; tell the story
