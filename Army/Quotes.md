“If you as a leader allow people to halfway do their jobs and don’t demand excellence as a prerequisite to keeping their job, you will create a culture of mediocrity. If you allow people to misbehave, underachieve, have a bad attitude, gossip, and generally avoid excellence, please don’t expect to attract and keep good talent. Please don’t expect to have an incredible culture.”
– Dave Ramsey in EntreLeadership

"What you tolerate, you condone."

“In the absence of orders, go find something and kill it.”
– Field Marshall Erwin Rommel
