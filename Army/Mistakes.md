"“It’s not your job as a leader to prevent mistakes from happening, it’s your job as a leader to correct mistakes as quickly as you can when they happen. If you try to lead by preventing mistakes from happening, nobody is going to take any chances and the company will slow down to a crawl because everyone is going to go, ‘well I don’t want to get into trouble, something might go wrong if we do that,’ and then everyone is going to go around asking for permission and then nothing gets done.”"
