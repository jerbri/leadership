# Initial-Counselings

This is based on a template I produced and have used with relative success.

## Key Points of Discussion

o DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES o "Do what you are told and be where you are supposed to be, when you are supposed to be there, with what you need to accomplish the mission, ready to perform."

o COMMUNICATION: As a National Guard Soldiers and a leader, we are expected to be reachable and respond in an appropriate time frame. Your knowledge, experience, and feedback are essential to the success of our team as well as the unit. o Ensure that you communicate up and down the chain of command, ensuring that your subordinates have the information they need to be successful. Respect me enough to let me know what is going on before someone else does or before you go outside the chain of command. o If a personal issue will detract from your professional responsibilities for any duration, please let me know so that I can either advise or direct work appropriately. As a leader, your focus on the mission at hand is crucial to our success as a unit.

o MILITARY BEARING / PROFESSIONALISM: Know, understand, and enforce the standard; both Army regulation and local SOPs. o Be prepared physically to complete any task ordered, and be an example in appearance and wear of the uniform. o "A man in authority who lets his subordinates get away with poor performance implies in doing so that they and their actions are of no significance..."

o UNIT ESPIRIT: I am proud to be an American Soldier and Guardsman. It's paramount that we take pride in the work that we do. Know the historical significance.

o COMPETENCE / MOS KNOWLEDGE: To be leaders, we must be a "jack of all trades," competent in the tasks that we ask our Soldiers to perform. Though it might not be practical to be an expert in every field, to employ our Soldiers properly, we must now their capabilities and requirements. Leaders are expected to prepare outside of "drill weekends."

o ARMY LEADERSHIP REQUIREMENTS MODEL o LEADERSHIP \(LEADS\): Leaders must be present. "It is difficult if not impossible, to lead from the rear." Lead by example. Show what right looks like. o TRAINING \(DEVELOPS\): "A good leader leads, and a great leader develops other leaders." NCODP / ODP is critical to develop the next generation of leaders and share the hard-won lessons of experience. Find and nurture your future team leaders, squad leaders, chiefs, and platoon sergeants. o PERFORMANCE \(ACHIEVES\): We will accomplish the mission tasked to us, focused on results instead of excuses. We must take care of our Soldiers, but always remember that completing the mission comes first. "It honors your subordinates to remember they are Soldiers... Guardsmen...; they are not your children or minor dependents. They are women and men who have voluntarily accepted the risks and necessary hardship that military service entails."

"BE PROUD, BUT NEVER SATISFIED." - Make yourself, the unit, and everyone around you better with your skills and passion.

## Plan of Action

o We will conduct counseling quarterly, prior to major training events, prior to your evaluation being completed, and at any time where I deem feedback to be productive to your progress as a steward of our profession.

o You will initiate your OER/NCOER Support Form within 30 days of this counseling \(my DOD ID: 1406993872\) and maintain it throughout your rating period; failure to do will result in delays in your evaluation completion or appropriate comments in the ACHIEVES block. Make sure you are credited with your hard work throughout the period.

o TRAINING o Ensure that all tasks are completed to standard. As a leader, it often comes down to simple checks to maintain integrity. o Keep your Soldiers actively engaged; respect them enough to make use of their time.

o EQUIPMENT o PMCS, Inventory, PCC/PCI's!!!! We are responsible for MISSION COMPLETION. o Know the status of our equipment and how it impacts mission readiness.

o PERSONNEL o Know your Soldiers, their strengths, their weaknesses, their passions, and what they want out of the National Guard. Who's a rock star? Who's a shammer? o Retention is important to mission completion. "People don't quit companies. They leave managers."

o DEVELOPMENT o Counsel, Counsel, Counsel. Document the counseling. Use it to improve your Soldiers, your section, and yourself. o Develop AND DOCUMENT SOPs to help improve competency across the unit; share your experience and knowledge. o Utilize Army Career Tracker to Identify and Indicate Desired Key Development and Broadening Assignments you desire.
