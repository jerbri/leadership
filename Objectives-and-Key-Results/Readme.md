Objectives and key results (OKR) is a framework for defining and tracking objectives and their outcomes.

The development of OKRs is generally attributed to Andy Grove the "Father of OKRs", who introduced the approach to Intel during his tenure there and documented this in his 1983 book "High output management". Grove explained his simple but effective concept thus: "The key result has to be measurable. But at the end you can look, and without any arguments: Did I do that or did I not do it? Yes? No? Simple. No judgments in it.
